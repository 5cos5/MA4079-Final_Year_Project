	abstract = {This paper presents a survey on the multi-trip vehicle routing problem (MTVRP) and on related routing problems where vehicles are allowed to perform multiple trips and corresponds to the article by Cattaruzza et al. (4OR 14(3):223–259, 2016). The ﬁrst part of the paper focuses on the MTVRP. It gives an uniﬁed view on mathematical formulations and surveys exact and heuristic approaches. The paper continues with variants of the MTVRP and other families of routing problems where multiple trips are sometimes allowed. For the latter, it specially insists on the motivations for having multiple trips and the algorithmic consequences. The expected contribution of the survey is to give a comprehensive overview on a structural property of routing problems that has seen a strongly growing interest in the last few years and that has been investigated in very different areas of the routing literature.},

A customer ship may place orders of more than one fuel type, and all orders placed by a customer ship do not have to be serviced by the same vessel, meaning customer splitting is possible. Fuel transported to the customer ships is allocated to compartments on board the supply vessels, and fuels of different types cannot be mixed in the same compartment.

Each request involves moving a number of goods from a pickup location to a delivery location. Our task is to construct routes that visit all locations such that corresponding pickups and deliveries are placed on the same route, and such that a pickup is performed before the corresponding delivery. The routes must also satisfy time window and capacity constraints.
            This paper presents a heuristic for the problem based on an extension of the large neighborhood search heuristic previously suggested for solving the vehicle routing problem with time windows. The proposed heuristic is composed of a number of competing subheuristics that are used with a frequency corresponding to their historic performance. This general framework is denoted adaptive large neighborhood search.
            The heuristic is tested on more than 350 benchmark instances with up to 500 requests. It is able to improve the best known solutions from the literature for more than 50\% of the problems.
            The computational experiments indicate that it is advantageous to use several competing subheuristics instead of just one. We believe that the proposed heuristic is very robust and is able to adapt to various instance characteristics.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new neural architecture to learn the conditional probability of an output sequence with elements that are discrete tokens corresponding to positions in an input sequence. Such problems cannot be trivially addressed by existent approaches such as sequence-to-sequence [1] and Neural Turing Machines [2], because the number of target classes in each step of the output depends on the length of the input, which is variable. Problems such as sorting variable sized sequences, and various combinatorial optimization problems belong to this class. Our model solves the problem of variable size output dictionaries using a recently proposed mechanism of neural attention. It differs from the previous attention attempts in that, instead of using attention to blend hidden units of an encoder to a context vector at each decoder step, it uses attention as a pointer to select a member of the input sequence as the output. We call this architecture a Pointer Net (Ptr-Net). We show Ptr-Nets can be used to learn approximate solutions to three challenging geometric problems – ﬁnding planar convex hulls, computing Delaunay triangulations, and the planar Travelling Salesman Problem – using training examples alone. Ptr-Nets not only improve over sequence-to-sequence with input attention, but also allow us to generalize to variable size output dictionaries. We show that the learnt models generalize beyond the maximum lengths they were trained on. We hope our results on these tasks will encourage a broader exploration of neural learning for discrete problems.},

We signiﬁcantly improve over recent learned heuristics for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), getting close to optimal results for problems up to 100 nodes. With the same hyperparameters, we learn strong heuristics for two variants of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), the Orienteering Problem (OP) and (a stochastic variant of) the Prize Collecting TSP (PCTSP), outperforming a wide range of baselines and getting results close to highly optimized and specialized algorithms.},

We analyse the performance of LNS on a number of vehicle routing benchmark problems. Unlike related methods, we use Limited Discrepancy Search during the tree search to re-insert visits. We also maintain diversity during search by dynamically altering the number of visits to be removed, and by using a randomised choice method for selecting visits to remove. We analyse the performance of our method for various parameter settings controlling the discrepancy limit, the dynamicity of the size of the removal set, and the randomness of the choice. We demonstrate that results produced by our technique are very competitive with Operations Research metaheuristic methods, indicating that constraint programming technology is directly applicable to vehicle routing problems.},

We propose an exact price-cut-and-enumerate method (EPCEM) that solves a novel superstructure-based formulation inspired by Paradiso et al. (2020) . The EPCEM obtains a tight lower bound by an alternating column and row generation method and computes a valid upper bound in the early stage of the algorithm. It obtains an optimal solution and further proves its optimality by a new multiphase sift-and-cut method. Computationally, the EPCEM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art exact method that only proves optimality for 9 of the 27 test instances with 50 customers. In particular, the EPCEM solves all test instances with up to 70 customers to optimality for the first time and obtains near-optimal solutions with an average optimality gap of no more than 0.3\% for instances with 80 to 100 customers. From a practical point of view, solving the CMTVRPTW by the EPCEM yields a solution that, on average, uses at least 45\% fewer vehicles and increases the travel cost by no more than 7\% compared with the solution to the standard CVRPTW.

	abstract = {The home-refill delivery system is a business model that addresses the concerns of plastic waste and its impact on the environment. It allows customers to pick up their household goods at their doorsteps and refill them into their own containers. However, the difficulty in accessing customers’ locations and product consolidations are undeniable challenges. To overcome these issues, we introduce a new variant of the Profitable Tour Problem, named the multi-vehicle profitable tour problem with flexible compartments and mandatory customers (MVPTPFC-MC). The objective is to maximize the difference between the total collected profit and the traveling cost. We model the proposed problem as Mixed Integer Linear Programming and present an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) algorithm to solve it. Our ALNS outperforms the commercial solver, Gurobi, and Large Neighborhood Search (LNS), as proven by giving better solutions within reasonable computational times. Both ALNS and LNS can obtain optimal solutions for all small instances and three better solutions than Gurobi for medium problems. Furthermore, ALNS is also robust and effective in solving large MVPTPFCMC, as proven by resulting in better solutions within less CPU time than LNS. Finally, more analyses are conducted to justify the utilization of flexible compartment sizes by comparing it with fixed compartment sizes and to evaluate the robustness of MVPTPFC-MC. The results show that utilizing flexible compartment sizes can yield more benefits than fixed compartment sizes, particularly when the fleet size is limited, and there are fewer mandatory customers to serve.},

Sophisticated Branch-Cutand-Price (BCP) algorithms for some of the most classical VRP variants now solve many instances with up to a few hundreds of customers. However, adapting and reimplementing those successful algorithms for other variants can be a very demanding task. This work proposes a BCP solver for a generic model that encompasses a wide class of VRPs. It incorporates the key elements found in the best recent VRP algorithms: ng-path relaxation, rank-1 cuts with limited memory, and route enumeration; all generalized through the new concept of “packing set”. This concept is also used to derive a new branch rule based on accumulated resource consumption and to generalize the Ryan and Foster branch rule. Extensive experiments on several variants show that the generic solver has an excellent overall performance, in many problems being better than the best existing speciﬁc algorithms. Even some non-VRPs, like bin packing, vector packing and generalized assignment, can be modeled and eﬀectively solved.},

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

One of their crucial utilization is in supply-chain management and scheduling for optimally routing transportation of goods by vehicles at a given set of locations. This paper discusses the broader problem of vehicle trafﬁc management, more popularly known as the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), and investigates the possible use of near-term quantum devices for solving it. For this purpose, we give the Ising formulation for VRP and some of its constrained variants. Then, we present a detailed procedure to solve VRP by minimizing its corresponding Ising Hamiltonian using a hybrid quantum-classical heuristic called Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), implemented on the IBM Qiskit platform. We compare the performance of QAOA with classical solvers such as CPLEX on problem instances of up to 15 qubits. We ﬁnd that performance of QAOA has a multifaceted dependence on the classical optimization routine used, the depth of the ansatz parameterized by p, initialization of variational parameters, and problem instance itself.},

It has many real-world applications, for example, routing technicians and disaster relief routing. In the TOPTW, a set of locations is given. For each, the proﬁt, service time and time window are known. A ﬂeet of homogenous vehicles are available for visiting locations and collecting their associated proﬁts. Each vehicle is constrained by a maximum tour duration. The problem is to plan a set of vehicle routes that begin and end at a depot, visit each location no more than once by incorporating time window constraints. The objective is to maximize the proﬁt collected. In this study we discuss how to use constraint programming (CP) to formulate and solve TOPTW by applying interval variables, global constraints and domain ﬁltering algorithms. We propose a CP model and two branching strategies for the TOPTW. The approach ﬁnds 119 of the best-known solutions for 304 TOPTW benchmark instances from the literature. Moreover, the proposed method ﬁnds one new best-known solution for TOPTW benchmark instances and proves the optimality of the best-known solutions for two additional instances.},

However, the complexity of the B\&B algorithm always grows exponentially with respect to the increase of the decision variable dimensions. In order to improve the speed of B\&B algorithms, learning techniques have been introduced in this algorithm recently. We further surveyed how machine learning can be used to improve the four critical components in B\&B algorithms. In general, a supervised learning method helps to generate a policy that mimics an expert but signiﬁcantly improves the speed. An unsupervised learning method helps choose diﬀerent methods based on the features. In addition, models trained with reinforcement learning can beat the expert policy, given enough training and a supervised initialization. Detailed comparisons between diﬀerent algorithms have been summarized in our survey. Finally, we discussed some future research directions to accelerate and improve the algorithms further in the literature.},

	abstract = {We investigate the exact solution of the vehicle routing problem with time windows, where multiple trips are allowed for the vehicles. In contrast to previous works in the literature, we speciﬁcally consider the case in which it is mandatory to visit all customers and there is no limitation on duration. We develop two branchand-price frameworks based on two set covering formulations: a traditional one where columns (variables) represent routes, that is, a sequence of consecutive trips, and a second one in which columns are single trips. One important diﬃculty related to the latter is the way mutual temporal exclusion of trips can be handled. It raises the issue of time discretization when solving the pricing problem. Our dynamic programming algorithm is based on concept of groups of labels and representative labels. We provide computational results on modiﬁed small-sized instances (25 customers) from Solomon’s benchmarks in order to evaluate and compare the two methods. Results show that some diﬃcult instances are out of reach for the ﬁrst branch-and-price implementation, while they are consistently solved with the second.},

	abstract = {A technique is presented for the decomposition of a linear program that permits the problem to be solved by alternate solutions of linear sub-programs representing its several parts and a coordinating program that is obtained from the parts by linear transformations. The coordinating program generates at each cycle new objective forms for each part, and each part generates in turn (from its optimal basic feasible solutions) new activities (columns) for the interconnecting program. Viewed as an instance of a “generalized programming problem” whose columns are drawn freely from given convex sets, such a problem can be studied by an appropriate generalization of the duality theorem for linear programming, which permits a sharp distinction to be made between those constraints that pertain only to a part of the problem and those that connect its parts. This leads to a generalization of the Simplex Algorithm, for which the decomposition procedure becomes a special case. Besides holding promise for the efficient computation of large-scale systems, the principle yields a certain rationale for the “decentralized decision process” in the theory of the firm. Formally the prices generated by the coordinating program cause the manager of each part to look for a “pure” sub-program analogue of pure strategy in game theory, which he proposes to the coordinator as best he can do. The coordinator finds the optimum “mix” of pure sub-programs (using new proposals and earlier ones) consistent with over-all demands and supply, and thereby generates new prices that again generates new proposals by each of the parts, etc. The iterative process is finite.},
