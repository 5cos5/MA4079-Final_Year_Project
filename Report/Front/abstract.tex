In this report, an optimisation problem for bunker supply operation is studied. Bunker supply involves delivering fuel, also known as bunker in the maritime industry to ships parked at anchorage. The operation is characterised as a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with various constraints, such as profit maximisation objective, capacity, time windows, multi-compartment and so on. Two methods are proposed, namely a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) and Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search (ALNS). These methods are then tested using test data generated from the Solomon benchmark for test cases with 25, 50 and 100 customers. The results show that ALNS is a practical method to find good routes for bunker supply.
